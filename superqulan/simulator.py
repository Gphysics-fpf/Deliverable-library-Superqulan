    """Integrate a time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation, with initial condition
    and given integration time-steps.

    The routine assumes that the user provides a vector of monotonously growing
    time steps, times[i] <= times[i+1]. The evolution among time-steps is
    estimated assuming that the Hamiltonian is approximately constant during
    those times.

    If 'collect' is provided and is a function, 'collect(t, state)' is invoked
    and the output is collected at each of these time steps. By default,
    the routine collects all wavefunctions. However, if 'collect' is 'None'
    the simulator only returns the final state.

    Args:
        times (ArrayLike): sequence of times use for the integration
        v0 (NDArray): initial state wavefunction
        H (Callable): function H(t) returning the Hamiltonian at time 't'
        collect (Callable or None): strategy for collecting information

    Returns:
        output (NDArray): If 'collect' is False, a 1D array containing the final
        state. Otherwise, it contains a 2D array, the rows of which are the output
        of 'collect(t,state)' or the 'state' evaluated at times[i].
