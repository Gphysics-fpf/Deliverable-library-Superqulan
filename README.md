# Deliverable-library-Superqulan
Library created within the context of the european project Superqulan whose purpose is to offer a simple way to do simulations in distributed quentum computing architechtures.

## TO DO list 
- [ ] Extend the type declaration to whole repository. 
- [ ] Create the class Architecture which contains the basic features of any setup. Then, the particular setups inherit form it.
- [ ] Merge the functions that are class related within the class, such as cav_WG_with_couplings. For that I thought of defining the variables qubit_indices, cav_indices...
- [ ] Think what is the best place to accomodate the controls. I think such place is within each particular experiment. 
- [ ] Think how to fit the quantum trajectories rutines in all of this, imo together with the evolution rutines is the best place.
- [ ] Think of the examples we are going to include to ilustrate the library, besides the ones we already have. GOOD CANDIDATES: State transfer with transmons, multipartite entanglement (maybe this one making use of two excitations)
